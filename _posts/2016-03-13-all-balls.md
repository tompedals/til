There is a fun feature in PostgreSQL where the string `allballs` is a [special date/time input](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-DATETIME-SPECIAL-TABLE) for 00:00:00 UTC.

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT 'allballs'::time;
{% endhighlight %}

When NASA say "all balls", what they mean is all zeros. From what I understand one of the PostgreSQL developers used to work for the
[Jet Propulsion Laboratory where it was a common term](http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/basics/bsf2-3.php). I need to start using
it too and pretend to be a rocket scientist.
